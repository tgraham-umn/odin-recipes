    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Posole is a winter staple for me. It's a nice warm soup from Mexico with a lot of flavor. I like to make a large
        portion to last throughout the week.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 yellow onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of cooking oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chili powder</li>
        <li>6 oz can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of kosher salt </li>
        <li>4 cups ofwater</li>
        <li>6 cups of chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 4 ounce cans of chopped green chiles</li>
        <li>2 15 ounce cans of white hominy</li>
        <li>3 cups of cooked, shredded pork shoulder</li>
        <li> 2 fresh limes</li>
        <li> 1 bunch of cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice the onion, then add it to a large soup pot along with the cooking oil. Sauté the onion in the
            oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, or until it is tender and transparent. Add the flour and chili powder
            and continue to sauté for two minutes more. The mixture will be fairly dry, so stir continuously to prevent
            burning.</li>
        <li>Add water, tomato paste, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt to the pot. Whisk the ingredients
            together until the tomato paste is dissolved. Allow the mixture to come to a simmer, at which point it will
            thicken.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the chicken broth, shredded meat, diced chiles, and hominy (drained). Stir to combine and then
            heat through (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Cut the lime into wedges and roughly chop the cilantro. Top each bowl with chopped cilantro and a wedge of
            lime to squeeze over top.</li>
    </ol>
